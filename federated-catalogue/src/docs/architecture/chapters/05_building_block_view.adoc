== Overall System overview
This document describes the architecture of the Federated Catalogue, a component inside the Gaia-X Ecosystem. It is a component of the Gaia-X Federation Services defined by the GXFS-DE project.

The Federated Catalogue is used to store and index Self-Descriptions and to answer queries over this index. The basic integration into the Federation Services is shown in <<system_overview>>.

The Catalogue is not directly accessed by end usersfootnote:[Here, this term comprises users outside a Gaia-X Ecosystem, i.e., what the Gaia-X Architecture Document calls End Users, a well as individual users acting on behalf of a Participant.]. The Catalogue offers an API, which might be used, e.g., from a Gaia-X Portal (offering a graphical user interface for end users).

Authentication within the Federation is realized by a dedicated component. It is not part of the Federated Catalogue. To demonstrate the integration, the Federated Catalogue offers an Authentication component, based on common, off the shelf software (see section <<_authentication>>).

The Federated Catalogue offers the possibility to verify Self-Descriptions. Therefore, signatures in Self-Descriptions must be verified, which requires trust anchors.  According to the Gaia-X Trust Framework, those trust anchors are available in the Gaia-X Registry.  When submitting Self-Descriptions, the public key is downloaded. The belonging X.509 certificate is then sent to the Gaia-X registry if it has a valid trust anchor.

=== Level 1: Components of the Federated Catalogue
The Federated Catalogue is not a monolithic application. It consists of multiple components, to reuse existing technology and to allow scaling. Those components can be deployed individually (see section <<section-deployment-view>>).

[#catalogue_components_high_level,reftext='Figure {counter:refnum}']
.Components of the Catalogue
image::05_catalogue_components_high_level.png[""]
The components are

[cols="1a,2a" options="header"]
|===
| **Name** | **Responsibility**
| Catalogue | Main component, implementing the core catalogue functionality.
| Authentication | External component implementing the authentication flow and user management.
| Graph-DB | Graph database, holding all claims contained in active Self-Descriptions. The Graph database is responsible for executing semantic search queries.
| File Store | The File store is a blob storage. It holds the Self-Description files and the files for the Schemas. This includes historical versions of the Self-Descriptions and Schemas.
| Metadata Store | Store for metadata on the Self-Descriptions, and Schemas stored in the File Store.
|===

==== Catalogue
The architecture of the core component is described in the next sections.

==== Authentication

The authentication component is responsible for authenticating users. This is not a central component of the catalogue, as it will be implemented by Lot 1 "Authentication & Authorization" of the GXFS-DE project. For the catalogue implementation, a mock integration is shown, using common, off the shelf software that implements the OpenID Connect standardfootnote:[https://openid.net/connect/[OpenID Connect]].

The responsibilities of the authentication components are:

* Storage of Users
* Storage of user roles for a Participant

A user belongs to only one Participant, on whose behalf he or she acts (see specification section 2.4 for more details).

For the implementation, Keycloak will be used. It is widely used and also part of the implementation of other lots. Therefore, this integration of different lots is simplified. The user will get a JSON Web Token (JWTfootnote:[https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519[JSON Web Token (JWT). RFC 7519. IETF, 2015.]]) with user claims and authorities, which is used to authenticate requests to the catalogue REST API.

An alternative implementation would be Lissifootnote:[https://lissi.id/[Lissi - Building trusted relationships]]. It is not further considered, as it is not as mature as Keycloak.

==== Graph database

The graph database holds the claims of verified, active Self-Descriptions. Claims of Self-Descriptions that fail the verification are not added to the graph database. Claims of Deprecated, Expired or Revoked Self-Descriptions will be deleted from the Graph database.

The Graph Database can be considered as a kind of search index. The single source of truth are the active Self-Descriptions, stored in the File Store. This means at any point in time the Graph database can be rebuilt from scratch by reimporting the claims of the Self-Descriptions. This allows the following:

. **Backup**: An explicit backup of the Graph database is not needed. Backing up the Self-Description files (located in the File Storage) and the metadata (located in the Metadata Store) is sufficient to allow the rebuild of the Graph Database.

. **Scalability**: Querying the Graph database might be the most critical part regarding performance. Therefore, the Graph Database can be replicated in the future by multiple, independent instances. Since there are no strict consistency requirements, changes in the Graph can be applied independently. In the control flow, all write operations on Self-Descriptions pass the Metadata Store. Therefore, the consistency can be enforced by that database.

Generically returning the Self-Description files containing claims that influence query response is not possible. To get the relevant Self-Description files, the query to the Graph Database can be formulated to return the Gaia-X entity that is the __credentialSubject__ of a Verifiable Credential. Then this can be used as a filter for the Self-Description endpoint, to download the Self-Description file.

Neo4j is used as implementation of the Graph database.

[IMPORTANT] 
.Limitation: queries to non-Enterprise Neo4j Graph database return empty record when no results found, rather than empty list.
====
When there is no data in the Graph database, i.e., no claims extracted from Self-Description, there is still a configuration node for the neosemantics modulefootnote:[https://neo4j.com/labs/neosemantics/4.0/config/[Configuring Neo4j to use RDF data]], which enables Neo4j to support the RDF data model, which is required here.
openCypher queries over all nodes without a +WHERE+ clause or without specifying relationships always return this node, unless regular users are revoked access from the configuration node as follows:
[source,cypher]
----
DENY MATCH {*} ON GRAPH neo4j NODES _GraphConfig TO PUBLIC
----
However this revoke operation is only supported in Neo4j enterprise.footnote:[https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/access-control/manage-privileges/#access-control-graph-privileges[Neo4j Cypher Manual 5. Managing privileges. Graph privilege commands.]]
We chose not to implement a workaround that involves query rewriting, as this may have harmful side effects.
====

==== File Store
The File Store is responsible to persist all file based content submitted to the catalogue. These are Self-Descriptions and Schemas.

For the sake of simplicity, a folder in the file system is used as file store. For future scalability the file store can be simply realized using an Object Storage or Database.

==== Metadata Store
In the Metadata Store persists the metadata for the elements (Self-Descriptions, Schemas and Trust Anchors). It allows to efficiently identify the relevant files in the file storage, to process the incoming requests.

It is realized as relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL or MariaDB). Since all write requests are handled by the database, the transactional functionality guarantees the consistency of the data.


=== Level 2: Description of the Submodules
image::05_catalogue_components.png["Components of the Catalogue"]

The catalogue implementation is structured into two main components _fc-service-server_ containing the logic to handle incoming requests, authorization and user management. The _fc-service-core_ components provide the individual functional building blocks for the federated catalogues features

[cols="1a,2a" options="header"]
|===
| **Name** | **Responsibility**
| Controller | Component handling and parsing the incoming requests.
| Service | Component, controlling the workflows and interactions between the subcomponents.
| Authorization | Handling the authorization, and user management in combination with the _Service_ and _Authentication_ component.
| Authentication | This component stores the users and participant metadata.
| Verification | Responsible for applied the defined verification rules on the Self-Descriptions. Also extracts the claims from the Verifiable Presentation (_Claim Extractor_). Also contains a component to periodically revalidate submitted Self-Descriptions (_Revalidation Service_).
| Graph Store | Interface and logic for communicating with the Graph DB.

| Schema Store
a| Responsible for:
* Verifying incoming schemas
* Storing the schema files
* Creating the unified schema graph
* Handling the relation between Terms and Schemas
* Handling the lifecycle and versioning of Schemas (persisted in the Metadata Store)

| Validator Cache | Component to store cached public keys. The keys were checked and validated when they were retrieved. To avoid expired public keys in the cache the deprecation date is regularly checked.
| Self-Description Store | Storing and retrieving of Self-Description files and handling the lifecycle and versioning of Self-Descriptions. Self-Descriptions are stored in the File Store, whereas metadata is kept in the Metadata Store.
| Metadata Store | Database keeping all the required metadata for the modules. The Metadata Store is _owned_ by the _Store_ components. For separation, each component gets its own set of tables with no relation between them.
| File Store | Storage system for persisting files (e.g., file system or object store/DB)
|===


==== Controller
The Controller component is responsible for parsing external (HTTP) requests and handling the Authentication flow with the Authentication service. It receives the results from the Services, formats them as appropriate, and sends the formatted results back to the original requester.

It is implemented as Spring Controllers.

The interface is a REST API. All defined endpoints, are available in the corresponding openAPI https://gitlab.com/gaia-x/data-infrastructure-federation-services/cat/fc-service/-/blob/main/openapi/fc_openapi.yaml[definition].

==== Service
The service component is responsible to call and orchestrate the different _fc-service-core_ components. It contains the interaction workflows for all the provided endpoints.

==== Authorization

The authorization component is highly coupled with the _Controller_.  It ensures that endpoints only be can be called by users, having the correct role.

Roles defined in the Catalogue:
[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===
| Role ID | Role Name
| Ro-MU-CA | Catalogue Administrator
| Ro-MU-A | Participant Administrator
| Ro-SD-A | Self-Description Administrator
| Ro-Pa-A | Participant User Administrator
|===
These roles do not form a linear hierarchy.

User Ro-MU-CA is allowed to execute all actions.

It is implemented with Spring Security.

==== Core Services (fc-service-core)

The Core Services receive calls from the service component and provide the building blocks to support the flows for the different operations.

==== Verification Service

The SD verification component checks if a Self-Description is correct from a semantic and cryptographic standpoint.

The flow for verifying Self-Descriptions is described in more detail in section <<_verify_self_description>>.

Notes:

* The SD is checked as a whole. If the verification of the VCs fails, the verification of the whole SD fails.

[source,java]
----

public interface VerificationService {

  /**

  VerificationResult verifySelfDescription(ContentAccessor payload,
      boolean verifySemantics, boolean verifySchema, boolean verifySignatures) throws VerificationException;

  /**
   * Extract claims from the given payload. This does not do any validation of the payload.
   *
   * @param payload The payload to extract claims from.
   * @return The list of extracted claims.
   */
  List<SdClaim> extractClaims(ContentAccessor payload);
}
----


===== Revalidation Service

This component periodically revalidates existing Self-Descriptions. It checks if the signatures are still valid (e.g. not expired or referencing DID is still available). If the validation of a Self-Description fails, it's either set to state _deprecated_ or _eol_. This will remove the Self-Description from the Graph Database.

Semantic revalidation is not needed here. It is done every time a new Schema is added.

===== Claim Extractor

This component is used by the _Verification Service_ to extract Claims from Self-Descriptions. Those claims are returned by the _Verification Service_ in the _Verification Result_.

==== Graph Store

The Graph Store is the interface for interacting with the Graph Database. It receives claims (extracted from Self-Descriptions) and adds them to the graph database. The Graph Database only contains claims from active Self-Descriptions and offers an openCypher query interface. External ontologies are not queried when processing requests.

[source,java]
----
/**
 * Defines the required functions to add, query, update and delete active claims extracted from self-descriptions
 */
public interface GraphStore {


    /**
     * Pushes set of claims to the Graph DB. The set of claims are list of claim
     * objects containing subject, predicate and object similar to the form of n-triples
     * format stored in individual strings.
     *
     * @param sdClaimList List of claims to be added to the Graph DB.
     * @param credentialSubject contains a self-description unique identifier
     */
    void addClaims(List<SdClaim> sdClaimList, String credentialSubject);

    /**
     * Deletes all claims in the Graph DB of a given self-description
     * @param credentialSubject contains a self-description unique identifier
     */
    void deleteClaims(String credentialSubject);

    /**
     * Query the graph when Cypher query is passed in query object and this
     * returns list of Maps with key value pairs as a result.
     *
     * @param sdQuery is the query to be executed
     * @return List of Maps
     */
    PaginatedResults<Map<String, Object>> queryData(GraphQuery sdQuery);

}
----


==== Self-Description Store

The Self-Description Store is responsible for storing Self-Description files (whole files, not individual VCs) and their metadata.
When handling a write request, it first stores the metadata in the Metadata Store, then the claims are added to the Graph database and finally the file is stored in the File Store. A transaction ensures, that the stored data is consistent.

==== Schema Management Store

The Schema Management Store is responsible for storing schema files and their metadata. It also supports the verification of schemas, as well as the possibility to generate the composite schema (union of all schemas).

When submitting (add, replace) a schema, the following verification steps will happen:

* For ontologies:
    ** Check that ontology IRI is present and valid (`SD-Sch-NF-01`)
    ** Check that ontology doesn't define a term (class, property or individual) that is already present. This is only allowed if the ontology IRI of the updated ontology is the same as the ontology that initially defined the term. (`SD-Sch-NF-03`)
    ** An Identifier will be extracted from the schema during the analysis process
* For shape graphs:
    ** Check if the file has the correct syntax.
    ** Check that there is no shape graph that already defines shapes with the same identifiers (`SD-Sch-NF-03`).
    ** The extractedId will be set to null during schema analysis. A generated Id will be added in the add schema process

* For SKOS:
    ** Check if the file has the correct syntax.
    ** Check that the terms (i.e., concepts) defined in the file are not defined yet (`SD-Sch-NF-03`).
    ** An Identifier will be extracted from the schema during the analysis process

Depending on the type of Self-Description, the Participant ID that has to be checked against the user who uploads the Self-Description, is stored in different locations.
If the Self-Description is a Service Offering, the ID is stored in the `issuer` variable. If the Self-Description is a Participant, the ID is stored in the `id` variable.
