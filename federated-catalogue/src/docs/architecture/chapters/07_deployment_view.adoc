== Deployment View

The Federated Catalogue is provided as a container based application. The different components are shown in <<img_deployment_view>>. The main component is the `Federated Catalogue Server`. It requires a PostgreSQL-Serverfootnote:[https://www.postgresql.org/[PostgreSQL: The world's most advanced open source database]] instance to store Self-Description metadata and a Neo4jfootnote:[https://neo4j.com/[Neo4j Graph Data Platform | Graph Database Management System]] instance to store the Self-Description graph and to support the query interface of the catalogue.

In addition, a Keycloak instance is needed to handle authentication. Keycloak, as well as the portal, used to interact with the Federated Catalogue, is considered out of scope for the Federated Catalogue itself.

<<img_deployment_view>> shows the default ports for the components' interaction. The connection settings (hostnames, ports) are configurable. It is recommended to replace the default credentials. To store persistent data, the `Federated Catalogue Server`, `PostgreSQL` as well as `Neo4J` require a volume, which must be mounted into the container.

Kubernetesfootnote:[https://kubernetes.io/[Kubernetes]] is the recommended infrastructure for production deployment. For development, Dockerfootnote:[https://www.docker.com/[Docker: Accelerated, Containerized Application Development]] in combination with docker-compose can be used.
