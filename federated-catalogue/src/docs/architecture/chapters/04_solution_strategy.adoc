== Solution Strategy

This chapter describes some basic concepts and details, when handling Self-Descriptions and Schemas. They are needed to understand the details

=== Self-Descriptions

==== Granularity of Self-Descriptions

According to the Gaia-X Architecture Documentfootnote:[https://gaia-x.gitlab.io/technical-committee/architecture-document//self-description/[Gaia-X Architecture Document / Self-Description Definition]],Self-Descriptions describe entities from the Gaia-X Conceptual Modelfootnote:[https://gaia-x.gitlab.io/technical-committee/architecture-document//conceptual_model/[Gaia-X Architecture Document / Conceptual Model]].  In its 22.04 version, on which the architecture of the first version of the Federated Catalogue is based, these were __Participant__ and __Service Offering__.

The Federated Catalogue does not support Self-Descriptions of __Resource__s in a free-floating way, i.e., directly submitted to the Catalogue rather than embedded into the Self-Description of a __Service Offering__.  This is because in Gaia-X, __Resources__ (e.g., data, software, hardware), are not provided directly for consumption, but composed into __Service Offerings__.  In a similar way, structured objects such as the postal address of a __Participant__ do not occur stand-alone, but only within a __Participant__ Self-Description.

Acknowledging the extensibility of schemas, the Federated Catalogue accepts not only Self-Descriptions of immediate instances of the __Participant__ and __Service Offering__ classes, but also of instances of classes that a schema defines to be their subclasses.

==== Identification of Self-Descriptions

Self-Descriptions are Verifiable Presentations according to the Verifiable Credentials Data Modelfootnote:[https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/[Verifiable Credentials Data Model v1.1. W3C Recommendation 03 March 2022]. Further details on how to use this data model in Gaia-X are specified in the Identity, Credential and Access Management Document (https://gaia-x.gitlab.io/technical-committee/federation-services/icam/credential_format/[GXFSv2 - Identity and Access Management / Credential format]).].  Thus, they are immutable and especially they are protected by cryptographic signatures. Therefore, a Self-Description cannot simply be updated. To change the definition of some entity described by a Self-Description, e.g., of a Service Offering, the Self-Description must be replaced by a new one. Therefore, any such entity needs a unique identifier. There can be only one __active__ Self-Description (in other words, a set of claims) per identifier. For our design of the Federated Catalogue, we consider the __credentialSubject__ the  unique identifier of a Description. That is, we assume that, in case one Self-Description, i.e., one Verifiable Presentation, contains multiple Verifiable Credetials, all of them state claims about the same subject.footnote:[Version 22.10 of the Gaia-X Identity, Credential and Access Management Document (https://gaia-x.gitlab.io/technical-committee/federation-services/icam/credential_format/[GXFSv2 - Identity and Access Management / Credential format]) leaves this open and thus also allow Verifiable Presentations to contain Verifiable Credentials talking about multiple different subjects. We do not explicitly contradict this point but require that such Self-Descriptions shall not be used __for the purpose of listing Participants and their Service Offerings in a Catalogue__, i.e., that any such Self-Descriptions shall be split into multiple separate ones per subject in a pre-processing step before submission to a Catalogue.]

This limitation to one subject per Self-Description means that, if a valid Self-Description is submitted to the Catalogue, it will invalidate all claims of the currently active Self-Description with the same __credentialSubject__. To identify any SD in the Catalogue, the `id` of the VC within the SD can be used. To track the (maybe invalidated) SDs affecting one Service or Participant, their ID and the __credentialSubject__ can be used.

As a consequence, the current implementation of the Federated Catalogue ignores the IDs of the Verifiable Presentations / Verifiable Credentials themselves; however, future implementations may use them.

=== Schema

==== Schema Types
The term Schema is the generic term for either an ontology (RDF Schema 1.1footnote:[https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/[RDF Schema 1.1. W3C Recommendation 25 February 2014]] or OWL 2footnote:[https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/[OWL 2 Web Ontology Language
Document Overview (Second Edition). W3C Recommendation 11 December 2012]]), shapes graph (SHACL 1.0footnote:[https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/[Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL). W3C Recommendation 20 July 2017]]) or controlled vocabulary (SKOSfootnote:[https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/[SKOS Simple Knowledge Organization System
Reference. W3C Recommendation 18 August 2009]]). There is no need to have a relation between the ontology, shape graph and vocabulary, as all of these may evolve independently. Therefore, an identification of a schema as a whole is not needed. So, for the sake of simplicity, those files where considered individually.

The classes and properties used in the Self-Descriptions are defined in underlying information models called ontologies.
In combination with the shapes graph these ontologies (which can come in the form of a complex, and possibly quite formal collection of terms or in the form of
controlled vocabularies where such strict formalism is not necessarily used) build a schema. It is to be noted that only the shapes graph of the schema are used
to semantically verify the Self-Description, meaning only the shapes graphs contain constraints on how to model a Self-Description.
The ontology graphs (including the controlled vocabularies) are solely used to give more context to the information model which is used by the Self-Description.
To support a good governance of the uploaded schema files, we enforce a few integrity constraints w.r.t. all schema files via the _SD-Sch-NF-*_ acceptance criteria.

==== Schema Validation Checks
Each schema before adding it, will be analysed. The Analysis process should check first
if the schema is syntactically and semantically valid instances of RDF-graphs in the
JSON-LDfootnote:[https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/[JSON-LD 1.1. A JSON-based Serialization for Linked Data. W3C Recommendation 16 July 2020]], Turtlefootnote:[https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/[RDF 1.1 Turtle. Terse RDF Triple Language. W3C Recommendation 25 February 2014]], and RDF/XMLfootnote:[https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/[RDF 1.1 XML Syntax. W3C Recommendation 25 February 2014]] serializations according to  SD-Sch-F-02.

Afterwards, a check if the schema is a valid SHAPE, ONTOLOGY or VOCABULARY is done.
Each type has its own restrictions. For example, ONTOLOGY schemas should not contain
multiple ontology IRIs, and they should always have an Ontology IRI according to SD-Sch-NF-01.
VOCABULARY Schemas should not contain multiple CONCEPT_SCHEME.

The analysis process should also return an identifier for  ontologies and vocabularies , but not
for shapes. In addition, extracted terms will be returned for all the schema types, so they
can be used in the adding and updating process.
