== Architecture Decisions

=== ADR 1: Monolithic vs. Microservices
**Context:** Are the subcomponents implemented as separate micro-services or are they integrated into a single service.

1. **Microservice**: Usage of different technologies possible, independent development, scalability, ...
2. **Single Service**: Easier maintainability, understanding, easier to handle concurrency (especially conflicting operations like adding SD and changing schema)

**Decision:** Implement catalogue as a modular, single service. It's easier to integrate the different components. Most components are called by only one other component. A distributed microservice implementation only introduces additional communication overhead. Scalability issues are not expected, since the main load is read-only and time consuming operations are queries against the graph db, which is a separate component that can be horizontally scaled.
Therefore, the Federated Catalogue is considered as microservice application within the GXFS ecosystem. The federated catalogue itself also consists of different, individually deployable components.

=== ADR 2: Intra Catalogue communication
**Context:** If the catalogue is implemented as one component, the subcomponents can communication using Method-calls. Another option is to implement an internal event-/notification system, whereby each component registers itself as a listener on other components or a central message bus.

1. **Method-Calls:** Easy to implement, clear structure and easy to debug. Limited options for extendability.
2. **Event-based:** Highly plugable systems, where new components can be added without other components knowing that. Additional indirection which causes complexity. Harder to debug.

**Decision:** The Catalogue es a static, pre-specified and configured component. Adding plugins during runtime is not needed. The maintainability of the catalogue is more important than additional flexibility.
