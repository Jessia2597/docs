# Business Federation

A business federation describes a federation which is built as an association between participants which have the same interest in business or the same business domain. This means the federation itself, is a legal construct around existing businesses without the capability to force the participants to change their internal processes. This kind of federation is the most common one, and requires additional constructs to establish the trust, because the initial trust is just given on a legal level.
