# Guild Federation

A guild federation is a federation which contains one or more participants which are at the same time principals of the federation. This can be freelancers, companies or others, which are part of the federation by “guild” purposes. The main difference to other federations is that this kind of federation knows their participants and registration/compliance processes are already in place. All participants have to accept this process, so far the federation doesn't offer or accept alternatives. This means, the issuance of credentials comes on top of existing processes, without the possibility of their members to avoid or change the process. This federation provides by default a common level of trust.
