# Introduction

> To get general information regarding Gaia-X and the Gaia-X Federation Services please refer to \[TAD\], \[TF\] and \[PRD\].

## Document Purpose

> The purpose of the document is to specify the requirements of the Identity Management and Trust Subcomponent "Trust Management Infrastructure for Gaia-X (TRAIN)" with the intention of a European wide public tender for implementing this software. The main audience for this document is attendees of the public tender, which are able to supply an open-source software solution for the area of identity and document verification with the purpose to provide digital support for existing certification bodies within Gaia-X.

## Product Scope

> The purpose of this product is to provide components for establishing and verifying the root of trust for participants in the distributed Gaia-X ecosystem and credentials issued by these entities. This is achieved through the introduction of trust lists combined with anchoring of pointers in the DNS. The conceptual framework for this is described in \[GX.TRUST\].
>
> Gaia-X Federations and other entities are supported in the sovereign publication and administration of trust lists for their specific trust frameworks. Verifying entities are supported in their sovereign trust decisions. To achieve this, the following functionalities MUST be developed:

-   Trust Framework Configuration

-   Trust List Management

-   Zone Manager Handler

-   Trusted Content Resolver (Extended Universal Resolver) + Libraries

-   DNS Zone Manager

>Please note that the libraries are intentional for different languages such as GO, Java, Python and Javascript. It's also intentional to create the libraries as helpers for using the extended universal resolver, by adding content resolver steps, validation routines for VC and other assistive functionalities.


> ![](./media/image2.png)
>
> If it's required to do code restructurings, modifying existing
> solutions by adding new microservices etc. (e.g., the universal
> resolver) then this is explicitly required.
>
> Please note, that it is explicitly required to deliver the software up and running. Responsibility for existing code cannot be shifted to previous development teams.

## Document Overview

> The document describes the product perspective, functions, and constraints. It furthermore lists the functional and non-functional requirements and defines the system features in detail. The listed requirements are binding. Requirements as an expression of normative specifications are identified by a unique ID in square brackets (e.g. **\[IDM.ID.EX.Number\]**) and the keywords MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, MAY, corresponding to RFC 2119 \[[[RFC 2119]](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119)\], are written in capital letters (see also \[IDM.AO\] - Methodology).

# Product Overview

## Product Perspective

> TRAIN provides a trust management infrastructure for Gaia-X Federation Services (GXFS). The TSA can use the Trusted Component Resolver Libraries to verify the institutional trust of verifiable credentials. The Organizational Credential Manager (OCM) can use the Trusted Component Resolver Libraries to validate the trust of the organizational verifiable credentials before storing them in the wallet. The Notary (via the Notarization API) uses the TSPA Connector to enroll trusted entities into the trust framework and add them via the TSPA/Federator to the Trust List.

    -   Trust Frameworks are anchored in DNS Pointer Resource Record (PTR RR)

    -   Trust List URI DID is anchored in DNS URI Resource Record (URI RR)

    -   DNSSEC allows for chain of trust

-   Enrollment of trusted entities into the Trust Framework (TSPA
    connector is responsible for this functionality):

    -   Notary (via the Notarization API) uses the TSPA connector to enroll trusted entities to the Trust Lists

-   Verifying the Institutional Trust of Verifiable Credentials:

    -   Trusted Content Resolver is responsible for this functionality

    -   Allows Global Discovery of Trust Frameworks through DNS Resolver

    -   The content from terms of Use of the verifiable credential will be used for trust discovery

    -   Verification of issuer details of the credential with the information of the trust list

    -   Integrity of VC must also be verified

    -   Integrity of the chain of trust of DNSSEC must be validated.

> This functionality MUST allow for the resolution of the trust list to find the issuer details in the trust list. The resolver MUST base of the DIF Universal Resolver[13] and MUST provide additional functionality to iterate recursive over DID Documents by resolving references in service endpoints during the standard resolving. The Resolver MUST integrate with the TSA via libraries. The resolving MUST be controllable by giving a list of endpoint types which are considered during the resolving by a defined range of actions. Responding content references MUST be collected and provided to the user either as list or as Callback during/after the resolving of standard documents. For instance, when a DID is resolved, the extended universal resolver collects additional DIDs from the service endpoint section (selected by types) and searches there again for other content. During this process, the defined content types are collected as reference. E.g., a list of URLs to type "gx-trusted-issuer" grouped by DID for a later processing by the libraries.

>
>The technology stack is mandatory to avoid integration impact.

-------

### Metrics

####   \[IDM.TRAIN.00047\] Opentelemetry Support 

> All helm charts/services MUST provide metrics endpoints in opentelemetry[24] format. 

###### [24] [<u>[https://opentelemetry.io/docs/]</u>](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/)

### Configurability

####   \[IDM.TRAIN.00048\] Configuration Profiles 

> Environment specific parameters MUST be configurable over the helm templates by using profiles. Each component MUST be delivered minimum for profile:

-   DEV, a local environment for round trip development and testing

-   Acceptance, a restricted resource environment (with minimal system requirements) which can be deployed in cluster (remote or locally)

-   Prod, a scalable environment with fault tolerance, HA settings and security hardening
 

####   \[IDM.TRAIN.00049\] Secret References in Helm Charts 

> The configuration secrets within Helm Charts MUST use secretRefs to support external Secret Management. Clear text secrets within the Helm Charts are not allowed.  

### Maintainability

> For a better scale out, maintainability and decentralization, the product architecture MUST have a microservice architecture. Each microservice MUST NOT be limited on the lines of code or number of days to implement. The service "size" SHOULD be oriented on the fine granular business capabilities. (e.g., Order, ListMenu, Payment).  

####   \[IDM.TRAIN.00051\] Domain Driven Design 

> To support the microservice architecture within the maintainability, a domain model MUST be declared before realization. The software description MUST explain which domain model was chosen, which services contain it and how it scales. This MUST be documented in the public code repository to support future enhancements for new developers.  

### Reusability

####   \[IDM.TRAIN.00052\] Enterprise Environments 

> All components MUST be reusable in different enterprise environments by customization and whitelabeling. This means that all components MUST be able to customize and white label the components by configuration settings (e.g., UIs, text labels, endpoints etc.)  

### Runtime Stability

####   \[IDM.TRAIN.00053\] Readiness Checkups 

> All components MUST reflect - after bootstrap and during runtime - the correctness of the service functionality by reflecting it over health endpoints. The health endpoint MUST return failure (red), if any internal behavior failure or misconfiguration occurs (not just the software running state). This means for instance to check continuously during runtime:

-   An unreachable configured Services results in failed state

-   Configured Service Endpoints need to be checked for readiness during runtime, if not reachable, it results in failure state

-   Check dependent components (Database, Microservice etc.) behind it, if not reachable, it results in failed state  

### High Availability Concepts

####   \[IDM.TRAIN.00054\] Redundant Deployment 

> Each deployment MUST be configured for a minimum fault tolerance of 2 instances.  

### Proof of Concept

####   \[IDM.TRAIN.00055\] Architecture Changes 

> All Architecture Changes MUST be aligned with the contractor before implementation.

####   \[IDM.TRAIN.00061\] SCS Environment 

> All HELM installations MUST run on SCS (Sovereign Cloud Stack). The [final acceptance] demonstration cannot be realized on azure, google cloud etc.  

## Functionality Acceptance Criteria

####   \[IDM.TRAIN.00062\] Zone Manager/TSPA Configuration 

> A domain was registered, and a DNSSec Server is linked to it. The product Zone Manager was installed on a machine, and it MUST be possible to link the Zone Manager with the DNSSec Server. The Zone Manager Handler MUST be configured to allow access to the zone manager (internal API). After this, using TSPA Trust Frameworks and DIDs can be published over the Zone Manager Handler into the zone file. After the rollout, using the endpoints of the TSPA with Dig commands and queries, the Trust Framework and DID (PTR and URI RR) of the Zone File are resolvable.  

####   \[IDM.TRAIN.00063\] Trust Zone Demonstration 

> Trusted Content publishing and resolution MUST be demonstrated over a public domain with DNSsec functionality. Various entries MUST be added to the zone and be resolved by the Trusted Content Resolver.  

####   \[IDM.TRAIN.00064\] Trust Framework cross-linking Demonstration 

> Cross-linking of Trust Frameworks MUST be demonstrated over two public domains with DNSsec functionality. A cross-link from one trust framework on domain 1 (using the PTR Record) MUST reference another Trust Framework on domain 2. Various entries MUST be added to the Trust Frameworks on domain 1 and domain 2 and be correctly resolved by the Trusted Content Resolver.  

####   \[IDM.TRAIN.00065\] Trust Framework and DID Enrollment 

> Trust Frameworks and their corresponding DIDs MUST be enrolled using API endpoints offered by the TSPA. The enrolled details MUST be reflected in the database and the DNS Zone file of the Name server.  

####   \[IDM.TRAIN.00066\] Trusted List Management using API endpoints 

> The Trust List content MUST be managed using API endpoints. Separate API endpoints MUST be available for performing CRUD Operations. 

####   \[IDM.TRAIN.00067\] Trusted Content Resolver resolves Trust Zone Pointers 

> The trusted content resolver is called by a Trust Framework Pointer (URL/DNS Name). The resolver recognizes that a DNS query must be made and it's starting to resolve the records about other Trust Framework Pointers (if applicable). After resolving the entire Zone, the DIDs of the RR/URI Records can be resolved as usual. Output is a List of Pointers which the resolver returns. 

####   \[IDM.TRAIN.00068\] Trusted Content Resolver resolves Trusted Content 

> The trusted content resolver is called by a DID, and a list of requested content types. The resolver resolves the DID, iterates through the service endpoint references, and returns a list of trust lists (no DID documents), regarding the given DID. The DID documents for the resolved references can be found in a second list.  

####   \[IDM.TRAIN.00069\] Trusted Content Resolver validates institutional trust of a Verifiable Credential 

> The issuer details of a credential MUST be validated with the resources found from the Trust List. This MUST be demonstrated with Trust Frameworks that are cross-linked to other Trust Frameworks (hosted on different domains) as well as Trust Frameworks that do not include a cross-linking. This MUST be available as integratable libraries for programming languages GO, Javascript, python and Java.

# Annex B: Overview GXFS Work Packages 

> The project "Gaia-X Federation Services" (GXFS) is an initiative funded by the German Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi) to develop the first set of Gaia-X Federation Services, which form the technical basis for the operational implementation of Gaia-X.
>
> The project is structured in five Working Groups, focusing on different functional areas as follows: Work Package 1 (WP1): Identity & Trust
>
> Identity &Trust covers authentication and authorization, credential management, decentral Identity management as well as the verification of analogue credentials.
>
> Work Package 2 (WP2): Federated Catalogue
>
> The Federated Catalogue constitutes the central repository for Gaia-X Self-Descriptions to enable the discovery and selection of Providers and their Service Offerings. The Self-Description as expression of properties and Claims of Participants and Assets represents a key element for transparency and trust in Gaia-X.
>
> Work Package 3 (WP3): Sovereign Data Exchange
>
> Data Sovereignty Services enable the sovereign data exchange of Participants by providing a Data Agreement Service and a Data Logging Service to enable the enforcement of Policies. Further, usage constraints for data exchange can be expressed by Provider Policies as part of the Self-Description
>
> Work Package 4 (WP4): Compliance
>
> Compliance includes mechanisms to ensure a Participant's adherence to the Policy Rules in areas such as security, privacy transparency and interoperability during onboarding and service delivery.
>
> Work Package 5 (WP5): Portal & Integration
>
> Gaia-X Portals and API will support onboarding and Accreditation of Participants, demonstrate service discovery, orchestration, and provisioning of sample services.
