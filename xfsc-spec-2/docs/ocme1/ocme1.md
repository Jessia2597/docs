### Document Purpose

> The purpose of this document is to specify the requirements of the Identity Management and Trust Subcomponent "Organization Credential Manager Extension 1" with the intention of a European wide public tender for implementing this software extension. Main audience for this document are attendees of the public tender, which are able to supply an open-source software solution for the area of identity and document verification with the purpose to provide digital support for existing certification bodies within Gaia-X.

### Product Scope

> The purpose of this extension is to provide changes to the OCM components to enhance the OCM in its functionality and adopt the latest Gaia-X requirements. The Organization Credential Manager Extension 1 (OCM.E1) enhances the participant's interaction with the SSI-based ecosystem in a trustful and secure environment. This comprises the utilization of the participants digital identity for different functionalities:

-   Extended management of secure and trustable connections with other parties

-   Refreshing and Revocation of verifiable credentials from attesting parties (e.g., Gaia-X Membership credential from a verified notary)

-   Utilization of AIP v2.0 alongside AIP v1.0 by updating the AFJ Framework

-   Provision of verifiable Public Profile



>The described functionalities allow other components in the Identity Management context to interact with the SSI-based ecosystem.

### Document Overview

> This document describes the product perspective, functions, and constraints. Furthermore, it lists the functional and non-functional requirements and defines the system features in detail. The listed requirements are binding. Requirements as an expression of normative specifications are identified by a unique ID in square brackets (e.g. **\[IDM.ID.Number\]**) and the keywords MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, MAY, corresponding to RFC 2119 \[RFC 2119\], are written in capital letters (see also \[IDM.AO\] - Methodology).

## Product Overview

### Product Perspective

>Please refer to \[TDR\].

### Product Functions

The functions of the Organization Credential Manager Extension 1 (OCM.E1) component are provided as a runtime component and MUST expose endpoints as REST services and made accessible over the network using encrypted connections (e.g., HTTPS). The scalability of these services MUST be taken into consideration using well-known and tested concepts like a microservice based architecture and load balancing. Since this component is the very core of trust relationships between participants in the Gaia- X ecosystem, security measures MUST be in place accordingly. This includes the protection of exposed service endpoints, data storage protection and access control. The storage for cryptographic material MUST be particularly secured, e.g., by integrating Hardware Security Modules. The overall functionality of the OCM.E1 component and exposed services MUST be auditable (in compliance with GDPR).

#### Metrics

###### \[IDM.OCM.E1.00044\] Opentelemtry Support 

> All helm charts/services MUST provide metrics endpoints in opentelemetry [10] format.

###### [10] [<u>[https://opentelemetry.io/docs/]</u>](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/)


#### Configurability

###### \[IDM.OCM.E1.00045\] Configuration Profiles 

> Environment specific parameters MUST be configurable over the helm templates by using profiles. Each component MUST be delivered minimum for profile:

-   DEV, a local environment for round trip development and testing

-   Acceptance, a restricted resource environment (with minimal system requirements) which can be deployed in cluster (remote or locally)

-   Prod, a scalable environment with fault tolerance, HA settings and security hardening


###### \[IDM.OCM.E1.00046\] Secret References in Helm Charts 

> The configuration secrets within Helm Charts MUST use secretRefs to support external Secretmanagement. Clear text secrets within the Helm Charts are not allowed.

#### Maintainability

###### \[IDM.OCM.E1.00047\] Micro Service Architecture 

> For a better scale out, maintainability and decentralization, the product architecture MUST have a micro service architecture. Each microservice MUST NOT be limited on the lines of code or number of days to implement it. The service "size" SHOULD be oriented on the fine granular business capabilities. (e.g., Order, ListMenu, Payment).

###### \[IDM.OCM.E1.00048\] Domain Driven Design 

> To support the micro service architecture within the maintainability, it MUST be declared a domain model before realization. The software description MUST explain which domain model was chosen, which services contain it and how it scales. This MUST be documented in the public code repository to support future enhancements for new developers.

#### Reusability

###### \[IDM.OCM.E1.00049\] Enterprise Environments 

> All components MUST be reusable in different enterprise environments by customization and whitelabeling. This means all components MUST be able to customize and white label the components by configuration settings (e.g., UIs, text labels, endpoints etc.)


#### Runtime Stability

###### \[IDM.OCM.E1.00050\] Readiness Checkups 

> All components MUST reflect after bootstrap and during runtime the correctness of the service functionality by reflecting it over health endpoints. The health endpoint MUST return failure (red), if any internal behavior failure or misconfiguration occurs (not just the software running state). This means for instance to check continuously during the runtime:

-   An unreachable configured Services results in failed state

-   Configured Service Endpoints needs to be checked for readiness during runtime, if not reachable, it results in failure state

-   Check depending components (Database, Microservice etc.) behind it, if not reachable, it results in failed state

#### High Availability Concepts

###### \[IDM.OCM.E1.00051\] Redundant Deployment 

> Each deployment MUST be configured for a minimum fault tolerance of 2 instances.

#### Proof of Concept

###### \[IDM.OCM.E1.00052\] Architecture Changes 

> All Architecture Changes MUST be aligned with the Client before implementation.
