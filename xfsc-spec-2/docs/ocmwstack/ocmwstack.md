## Document Overview

> This document describes the product perspective, functions, and constraints. It furthermore lists the functional and non-functional requirements and defines the system features in detail. The listed requirements are binding. Requirements as an expression of normative specifications are identified by a unique ID (e.g. **IDM.ID.Number**) and the keywords MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, MAY, corresponding to RFC 2119 \[RFC 2119\], are written in capital letters (see also \[IDM.AO\] - Methodology).

# Product Overview

## Product Perspective

> The product is necessary to establish trust and credential exchange between the different participants within the Gaia-X ecosystem and to create a level of trust using a decentralized approach.
>
> The product fulfills parts of the functionality that an identity provider provides for centralized or federated identity approaches but in a decentralized fashion using concepts of decentralized identity, verifiable credentials, and verifiable presentations.
>
> To achieve this goal, components are required that on the one hand allow the management of a participant identity for the creation of signatures for various properties, attributes, and documents, and on the other hand enable the verification of external documents. This includes the creation of verifiable credentials with a corresponding digital signature based on an identity, the issuing of verifiable presentations based on existing and already received verifiable credentials, the requesting of verifiable credentials from third parties for the attestation of own attributes, for example, as well as the validation of incoming connection requests and proof requests. The format used for communication is based on the RFCs described in the W3C [1,2] and OpenID specifications \[OIDC\] to guarantee a uniform process flow and exchange formats.

## Product Functions

>The functions of the Organization Credential Manager W-Stack (OCM.W-STACK) component are provided as a runtime component and MUST expose endpoints as REST services and made accessible over the network using encrypted connections (e.g., HTTPS). The scalability of these services MUST be taken into consideration using well-known and tested concepts like a microservice based architecture and load balancing. Security measures MUST be in place accordingly. This includes the protection of exposed service endpoints, data storage protection and access control. The overall functionality of the OCM.W-STACK component and exposed services MUST be auditable (in compliance with \[GDPR\]).

> The Connection Manager MUST provide a Create Invitation endpoint as well as a connection acceptance endpoint. The response body is composed of JSON content. A connection SHOULD be accepted and made consumable only if the Trusted Content Resolver responds accordingly.
>


#####   \[IDM.OCM.W-STACK.00020\] Connection Information Endpoint/s 

> The Connection Manager MUST provide a connection information endpoint where other components can request if a connection for a specific DID/ID already exists. The endpoint supports as input a ConnectionID or a DID as well as a flag for "all-information" which also covers all received presentations and issued credentials and responds with existing information (connection status, ConnectionID, if requested additional information) or nothing if it does not exist. An endpoint or the same endpoint without parameters must be provided to return all connections.  


#####   \[IDM.OCM.W-STACK.00021\] Connection Status 

> The Connection Manager MUST provide a function that allows a component to subscribe/unsubscribe for connection events to receive updates when the status changes. A list of subscribers MUST be in place and maintained based on the respective implementation. (subscribe, unsubscribe MUST be possible). This functionality of publishing events SHOULD be provided via a REST service, but a message bus system can also be considered.  

#####   \[IDM.OCM.W-STACK.00022\] Connection Update 

> The Connection Manager MUST provide an endpoint that allows a component to update a connection entry by connectionID or DID.  

#####   \[IDM.OCM.W-STACK.00023\] Connection Deletion

#### Reusability

#####   \[IDM.OCM.W-STACK.00081\] Enterprise Environments 

> All components MUST be reusable in different enterprise environments by customization and whitelabeling. Means all components MUST be able to customize and white label the components by configuration settings (e.g., UIs, text labels, endpoints etc.)  

### Runtime Stability

#####   \[IDM.OCM.W-STACK.00082\] Readiness Check Ups 

> All components MUST reflect after bootstrap and during runtime the correctness of the service functionality by reflecting it over health endpoints. The health endpoint MUST return failure (red), if any internal behavior failure or misconfiguration occurs (not just the software running state). This means for instance to check continuously during the runtime:

-   An unreachable configured Services results in failed state

-   Configured Service Endpoints needs to be checked for readiness during runtime, if not reachable, it results in failure state

-   Check depending components (Database, Microservice etc.) behind it, if not reachable, it results in failed state  

### High Availability Concepts

#####   \[IDM.OCM.W-STACK.00083\] Redundant Deployment 

> Each deployment MUST be configured for a minimum fault tolerance of 2 instances.  

### Proof of Concept

#####   \[IDM.OCM.W-STACK.00084\] Architecture Changes 

> All Architecture Changes MUST be aligned with the Principal before implementation.
