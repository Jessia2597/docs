## Document Overview

> The document describes the product perspective, functions, and constraints. It furthermore lists the functional and non-functional requirements and defines the additional system features in detail. The listed requirements are binding. Requirements as an expression of normative specifications are identified by a unique ID in square brackets (e.g. **\[IDM.ID.EX.Number\]**) and the keywords MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, MAY, corresponding to RFC 2119 \[RFC 2119\], are written in capital letters (see also \[IDM.AO\] - Methodology).

# Product Overview

## Product Perspective

> The personal credential manager is used by a natural person. Within the Gaia-X terminology, such a natural person is named *principal*. The principal utilizes the PCM in the respective form factor to store VCs issued to her/him as well as to prove the statements necessary to obtain a service.
>
> The PCM must extend the support of following overall processes:

-   DIDComm Authentication as the generic way to authenticate a principal

-   Secure backup and restore by file

-   SIOP DID as a method to implement SSI based Login Methods \[DID SIOP\]

-   Consent Management

-   OIDC4VP for presenting Credentials

-   OIDC4VC to receive Credentials

-   Remote Management and Usage of cPCM

-   DID Document Based Protocol Selection

-   AIP 1.0 Protocol

-   AIP 2.0 Protocol \[AIP2.0\]

-   Bi-directional synchronization with Cloud Personal Credential Wallet

-   Train Selection

> The existing code base MUST be reused and further improved. Other microservices MAY have different languages and architectures.
----------

## Product Functions

> Personal Credentials Manager (PCM) enables end-users to interact with the DID-based ecosystem in a privacy-preserving way. PCM acts as a user representative tool which is securely holding the acquired distributed identities and identity attributes and provides the technical means to selectively disclose the aforementioned attributes for authentication and service consumption. The following represents the high-level functional architecture of the PCM.

![](./media/image3.png)

> Figure 1: Personal Credentials Manager. Layering overview (s. appendix C)
>
> As presented in the PCM big picture layering overview, PCM consists of different components which effectively comprise the following layers:

-   The front-end layer

-   PCM Core (Wallet) layer

-   as well as the Mediator (Relay) layer

> **The front-end layer** is comprised of the following features and components:

-   End User Authentication

-   Graphical User Interface (GUI)

-   Local Input Interfaces

> *End User Authentication* component provides for the implementation of secure user authentication policies which can include but are not limited to fingerprint authentication in the smart phone case, PIN, password, etc.
>
> *The GUI component* enables end users to interact with the PCM and use the PCM functions. *Local Input Interfaces* comprise QR-code processing, bootstrapping over Near Field Communication (NFC), etc., and by that provides communication initiation, direct, or peer-to-peer (contact) exchange as well as credentials presentation ensuring the
> direct proximity requirements.
>
> **PCM Core (Wallet) layer** consists of the following features and components:

-   W3C VC synchronization with cPCM for offline Presentation

-   Consent Management over cPCM

-   Remote Management of cPCM

-   Backup/Restore over cPCM

-   Remote Control of the Cloud PCM by using a didcomm protocol over the websocket connection

> The *Managing Credentials* feature provides the functionality for receiving credentials issued by other participants, enabling the user to view and inspect his/her credentials, and the basic functionality for proofing credential attributes to other participants according to the SSI paradigm. The credential manager ensures that the user is always in control, which attributes are provided to which participant. It further enables to create and check proofs according to the SSI paradigm to, for example, achieve DIDComm or SIOP Login, etc.
>
> The *Wallet Backup* feature provides for the secure backup and restore capabilities of the obtained credentials and possibly the app settings.
>
> The automatic synchronization feature enables the users to configure a unique channel of communication between PCM and cPCM. Which enables the und users to synchronize W3C VC from PCM to cPCM and via versa.
>
> The figure below is the planned component structure which are a matter of this tender (derivations allowed from SW perspective):

## Product Constraints

#####   \[IDM.PCM.E1.00000\] OID4VP/VC Compatibility 

> The PCM MUST support exchange over OID4VP protocol \[OID4VP\] and all other applicable standards needed for communication with the Organization Credential Manager and OCM W- Stack \[IDM.OCM.W-STACK\].
>  

#####   \[IDM.PCM.E1.00001\] AIP 2.0 Compatibility 

> The PCM MUST support AIP 2.0 as specified in Aries Interop Profile \[AIP2.0\].  

#####   \[IDM.PCM.E1.00002\] Offline Presentation 

> All W3C credentials in the wallet (including the synced one) MUST be available for the offline presentation. "Offline" is in this case defined as "No third Party involved" which is able to track the data. Means the presentation MUST be possible by QR Code, NFC or Bluetooth peer to peer from one Smartphone to the other. This includes a capability to identify trusted verifiers and issuers on the smartphone before presentation e.g., by using Bloom Filters.  

#####   \[IDM.PCM.E1.00003\] Cloud PCM 

> The Cloud PCM (also part oft his tender) MUST be used as Integration Layer and as remote backend to store and synchronize W3C credentials including the remote management/control of the cPCM agents and backup storage. The cPCM connection MUST NOT implement Aries
>
> Protocols or Aries RFCs, because the PCM and cPCM connection acts as private connection of the PCM Smartphone App with its private backend (cPCM).

> Table 3: Apportioning of Requirements

# Requirements

> Further binding requirements can be found in \[TDR\].

## External Interfaces

### User Interfaces

#####   \[IDM.PCM.E1.00006\] Smartphone GUI 

> The PCM MUST provide a GUI for the PCM user to support the enhancements for the Cloud PCM. This requires support for Consent Management, as well for Notifications and the support of W3C credentials provided by the OCM W-Stack \[IDM.OCM.W-STACK\].  

### Hardware Interfaces

#####   \[IDM.PCM.E1.00007\] Camera 

> The PCM MUST be able to use the Smartphone's camera to scan QR-Codes for W3C credentials and OpenID4VC issuing Proposals \[OID4VC\].  

#####   \[IDM.PCM.E1.00008\] NFC 

> The PCM must be able to use the Smartphone's NFC communication to receive DIDComm invitation messages, OpenID4VC Issuing Proposals and W3C Credentials.  

### Software Interfaces

#####   \[IDM.PCM.E1.00009\] Secure Storage 

> The PCM implementation MUST be able to use secure storage (internal storage, encrypted storage, dedicated key storage) by using enclaves provided by the target platform/smartphone operating system for storing PCM data within the smartphone. Especially for key exchange between the Cloud PCM and the PCM App is this required to protect the keys safely. It's highly recommended to use asymmetric encryption protocols by utilizing internal enclaves to exchange the keys (e.g., CMS or other schemes)  

### Communications Interfaces

#####   \[IDM.PCM.E1.00010\] DIDComm v2 Interface 
> The DIDComm interface MUST be provided to send DIDComm messages to be processed by the PCM and the PCM Cloud.  

#####   \[IDM.PCM.E1.00011\] NFC 

> The PCM App MUST support the exchange of W3C VCs/VPs and Connection invitations by using NFC (reading and presentation).  

#####   \[IDM.PCM.E1.00011\] Local SIOP Endpoint 

> The PCM MUST provide an endpoint for SIOP requests \[DID SIOP\]. Within the SIOP protocol, the PCM implements the role of the Self-Issued OpenID Provider (SIOP). Applications (PRs (Relying Parties) in SIOP terminology can send SIOP requests to the PCM. The PCM will process such requests and reply with a SIOP response. The SIOP process MUST be triggerable via an URL scheme which is registered during the App Installation (e.g., gxfspcm://siop?\...)  

#####   \[IDM.PCM.E1.00012\] Personal Wallet and Secrets Synchronization 

> Given that PCM users for security reasons import or export their Personal Wallet and secrets, an interface MUST be provided so that Synchronization between PCM and Cloud Wallet (cPCM) can be established by using web socket protocols. This feature is dedicated to W3Cs and is not relevant for Aries based credentials. All secrets relevant for presentation of W3C credentials MUST be transferred encrypted and in an approach that the private key isn't transmitted at once and just "activatable" by user knowledge.

> When users are authenticated, then they can receive notification for "Connection" via QR-Code, Text input (URL), NFC. The information is shown to the users via the GUI and requests can be validated. The users can accept or to reject the request. When the request is accepted, then the PCM performs the DIDComm protocol required to establish the connection. The connection must be established and stored in the PCM storage, so that it can be used later.  

### Managing credentials - Verification

#####   \[IDM.PCM.E1.00064\] Receive a Verifiable Credential (VC) 

> When a user is authenticated and within an established connection, the user must get notification for VC issuing requests. The user must get the possibility to accept or to reject the request. The request is validated, and the information is shown to the user via the GUI. The issued credential MUST be stored in connected OCM(s) of the cPCM and synced to PCM in the case of a W3C credential. In the case of an Indy credential, the App MUST show the credential by using the remote functionality but MUST NOT sync the indy credential physically. In both cases, two credentials are visible in the PCM App, the indy one is highlighted as "cloud credential", the other one as "Local Credential". When the PCM App receives a Indy/W3C credential directly from an OCM, the credential MUST be also marked as "Local Credential". Is any "cloud credential" removed from an connected OCM within the cPCM, the App will sync those changes and push the credential to history overview.  

#####   \[IDM.PCM.E1.00065\] Answer Request for Verifiable Presentation (VP) 

> When users are authenticated and Connection established, then:

-   If the user has given his consent, a VP has been proved to the verifier.

-   If the presentation has not been completed successfully, problems have been reported to the users via GUI.

> The App MUST demonstrate that (synced) W3C or Indy Credentials can be presented offline without any connection to the cPCM. In the online case, the App MUST demonstrate that a credential can be presented via the remote control of the cPCM.  

#####   \[IDM.PCM.E1.00066\] Display history of presenting verifiable presentations (VPs) 

> When users are authenticated, then they can view detailed information about the history of showing/proofing identity information to other participants. History information must list information about the transaction date and time, and to whom has been presented.  

#####   \[IDM.PCM.E1.00067\] Restore Backup 

> When users are authenticated, they must have a function to restore a backup containing all information stored in the PCM and Cloud wallet (cPCM). When users select the backup file, the restore must be performed only after confirming the security authentication. When successful restoration is completed, users should be informed about the status and they must see all their data(such as VC, Connections, etc.).  

#####   \[IDM.PCM.E1.00068\] Card View 

> The PCM MUST present all credentials as cards (like credit cards), with a logo if the credential is in the cloud available or local. The view MUST support easy selection and combination of credentials for the different remote and local use cases.  

### Credential Wallet synchronization

> The cPCM MUST implement a function to process SIOP requests \[DID SIOP\] in the role of the Self- Issued OpenID Provider (SIOP). Applications (RPs (Relying Parties) in SIOP terminology) can send SIOP requests to the PCM. The PCM will process such requests and reply with a SIOP response.  

### App Settings Configuration (personalization) - Verification

#####   \[IDM.PCM.E1.00073\] Configure cloud wallet linking 

> When users are authenticated, the PCM MUST enable the users to configure secure connection(management link) to Cloud wallet. 

### Ledger Selection - Verification

#####   \[IDM.PCM.E1.00074\] Select Ledger 

> The PCM MUST not be enabled to select compatible Ledgers from the PCM GUI. The selection is pre-configured from a list of supported ledgers during the build process.  

### Mediator Selection - Verification

#####   \[IDM.PCM.E1.00075\] Select Mediator 

> The PCM MUST be able to work with different Mediators by using the DID Document, without recompiling the app.  

### Cloud Wallet Management - Verification

#####   \[IDM.PCM.E1.00076\] Remote controller of the Cloud PCM (cPCM) 

> The PCM user MUST be able to control the basic functions of the Cloud PCM(cPCM) such as Consent management, Connection Acceptance, Presentation Allowance, Issuing and Credential management. When users are authenticated and secure management connection is established with cPCM, then the users must be able to consent and access to existing documents.  

#####   \[IDM.PCM.E1.00077\] Plugin Management 

> The plugin management of the cPCM MUST be supported in the App. It MUST be possible to use the plugins, configured and enable/disable them remotely. The remote protocol MUST be used to request from plugins a token, present that token to verifiers or holders. All other standard functionality like issuing of credentials, consent etc. which the plugin framework of the cPCM offers, must be supported as well.
