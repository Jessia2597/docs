# Introduction

> To get general information regarding Gaia-X and the Gaia-X Federation Services please refer to \[TAD\] and \[PRD\].

## Document Purpose

> The purpose of the document is to specify the requirements of the Compliance subcomponent "Notarization API Extension 1" with the intention of an European wide public tender for implementing this software extension. Main audience for this document are attendees of the public tender, which are able to supply an open-source software solution for the area of identity and document verification with the purpose to provide digital support for existing certification bodies within Gaia-X.

## Product Scope

> The product scope is to extend the existing component "Notarization API", with the following new features:

-   Protocol agnostic issuances depending on the incoming DID and format
    definitions

-   New issuance and verification protocols

-   Business validation flow for the notary

-   Documentation for using NOT as the compliance service for
    memberships

-   Dynamic schema configuration

-   Enrollment of organization to certain trustlists

-   Trust verification before the issuance process with the TRAIN module

-   Automatic Notarization Verification

--------
> ![](./media/image2.png)

>The product extension must include interfaces (API's) to integrate the notarization component smoothly in external software for Non-IT operator usage (e.g., lawyers, notaries, governments, certifiers \...).
> If it's required to do code restructurings, modifying the current solution by adding new microservices etc. then this is explicitly allowed.
> Please note, that it is explicitly required to deliver the software up and running. Responsibility for existing code cannot be shifted to previous development teams.

## Document Overview

> The document describes the product perspective, functions, and constraints. It furthermore lists the functional and non-functional requirements and defines the system features in detail. The listed requirements are binding. Requirements as an expression of normative specifications are identified by a unique ID in square brackets (e.g. **\[CP.NOTAR.Number\]**) and the keywords MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, MAY, corresponding to RFC 2119 \[[RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119)\], are written in capital letters (see also \[IDM.AO\]-   Methodology).

# Product Overview

## Product Perspective

> The purpose of this product extension is to support the trust establishment with new enrollment processes. To reach this goal the software component extension should follow standard formats of credential exchange and enrollment. Therefore, this extension introduces new components. The following problems are being addressed with this extension:

-   Interoperability with other ecosystems & future technology

-   Trust anchor enrollment

-   Trust verification



>This allows each federation to create and host their own trust anchors and policies. Next to that they can choose between multiple ecosystems. The trust verification module with TRAIN allows the relying parties to verify trust chains more easily before issuing respective certificates.


-------
> ![](./media/image2.png)

> The existing code base [1] MUST be reused and further improved. Other microservices MAY have different languages and architectures.

###### [1] [<u>[https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse/xfsc/not]</u>](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipse/xfsc/not)
-------
## Product Functions

> The product extension itself follows the microservice component design principles. The functionality is exposed per REST Service and accessible over the Network per HTTPS protocol. The component has to be installed in multi locations and SHOULD NOT be planned as a central hosted system. Therefore, it must be possible to install it within the issuer's organization domain with multiuser access capabilities. The access to the offered functionality of the component extension MUST be protected for the usage in such an environment. This includes role concepts, data storage protection and access control. The overall functionality of the product MUST be auditable (GDPR conform), which means each action MUST be documented with all context-specific information within the system.

> The main functionality scope of this product extension is to provide a way to enroll new issuers considering the defined policies of the Trust Framework [2] and the federation itself. It also allows Business owners to use different did-methods and be part of other ecosystems. That means each federation can create their own rulebook and allow their own ecosystems.
>
> The core functions of the product extension are:

-   Enrollment of new issuers and authorities

-   TRAIN validation & verification [3] \[IDM.TRAIN\]

-   DID method abstraction

-   Credential issuance & verification

-   Automated external business validations

## Functional

##### \[CP.NOTAR.E1.00014\] Enrollment of new issuers and authorities 

###### <i> Description </i>

> The enrollment process of new issuers is a process to set a DID and the respective configuration on a trustlist of a federation. This process can be started with the request endpoint and MUST be defined with one attribute. The request of the enrollment MUST follow the same flow as any other request.

> After the confirmation of the request from the notary the action / output MUST be a new entry on an existing trustlist. To add an entry on the trustlist the TRAIN enrollment module needs to be called.

###### <i> Constraints </i>

-   Own DID for issuing.

-   DID of the organization.

-   Database system.

###### <i> Interfaces </i>

-   TRAIN enrollment module.

-   Database interface.

2.  The requestor is able to issue the VC mentioned on the trustlist.



##### \[CP.NOTAR.E1.00015\] TRAIN validation & verification 

###### <i> Description </i>

> The TRAIN validation service needs to be included in the process of verifying a verifiable presentation. If a requestor is showing a verifiable presentation during a task which needs to be fulfilled, the notarization service needs to validate the terms Of Use by calling the TRAIN validation module \[IDM.TRAIN.00017\]. This will verify if the shown verifiable presentation and the respective owner of it is on a trust list.

###### <i> Constraints </i>

-   DID of the organization.

-   Database system.

###### <i> Interfaces </i> 

-   TRAIN validation module.

###### <i> Input </i>

-   A verification with an incoming verifiable presentation.

###### <i> Output </i>

###### <i> Acceptance Criterias </i>

1.  The terms Of Use could successfully be verified and validated.

2.  The presentation could successfully be proved cryptographically and
    semantically.


##### \[CP.NOTAR.E1.00016\] DID method abstraction 

###### <i> Description </i>

> The SSI Issuance controller MUST be able to understand multiple DID methods and MUST also issue the Credential in the respective issuance protocol. The focus MUST lay on the DID methods EBSI, Sovrin (Indy), Web and Key. The notarization service MUST be enhanced with a connection to the EBSI ledger. Depending on the incoming request the SSI Issuance service MUST decide which credential exchange protocol \[CP.NOTAR.00022\] should be used. The selection of which one must be used depends on which service endpoint is available on the DID document of the requestor. The DID:Web method MUST be configurable for issuing credentials.

###### <i> Constraints </i>

-   DID of the organization.

-   Database system.

-   CP.NOTAR.00022 credential issuance extension

###### <i> Interfaces </i>

-   Database interface.

-   Issuance Endpoint

###### <i> Input </i>

> 1. Successful managed request.


##### \[CP.NOTAR.E1.00017\] Credential Issuing extension 

###### <i> Description </i>

> The existing SSI issuance service needs to be enhanced with a new protocol to issue verifiable credentials. If a DID supports the respective endpoint the issuance service should use the OpenID for Verifiable credential issuance protocol \[OpenID VCI\] and the component can perform a Present Proof request before issuing defined in OpenID for Verifiable Presentations \[OpenID VP\]. The credential issuing is an asynchronous process which checks the database for confirmed request records in the database. All of the found confirmed records will be picked up. Within the record MUST be a linked DID of the participant, which is here used to establish a connection to the Credential Manager (OCM and PCM) of the participant.

###### <i> Constraints </i>

-   Own DID for issuing.

-   DID of the organization.

-   Database system.

-   OpenID for Verifiable credential issuance.

-   OpenID for Verifiable Presentations

###### <i> Interfaces </i>

-   Database interface.

-   Issue Endpoint.

###### <i> Input </i>

-   A confirmed request record.

###### <i> Output </i>

-   An issued credential to the participant DID.

###### <i> Acceptance Criteria </i>

1.  Credential successfully issued to participant DID.

2.  Credential has the exact type of the request context.

3.  Deletion of the request record, after successful issuing.


##### \[CP.NOTAR.E1.00018\] Proof of Credentials extension 

###### <i> Description </i>

> To prove the trustworthiness of this product extension, it MUST support the OpenID for Verifiable Presentations and it MUST be configurable which proofs are fulfilled automatically (e.g., based on a configured schema). If a DID supports the respective endpoint, the SSI service should use the OpenID for Verifiable presentations protocol. In the case of a JSON-LD Presentation an extended validation MUST be supported via TRAIN \[IDM.TRAIN\]. After the cryptographic proofing the semantic validation MUST happen via TRAIN. This SHOULD validate the Trust against the Trust Framework and registries.

###### <i> Constraints </i>

-   Control over the Own DID.

-   OpenID for Verifiable presentations protocol.

-   TRAIN.

###### <i> Interfaces </i>

-   Issue Endpoint

-   TRAIN

###### <i> Input </i>

-   Any presentation request described in OpenID for Verifiable
    Presentations.

###### <i> Output </i>

-   A presentation request according to OpenID for Verifiable
    Presentations.

###### <i> Acceptance Criteria </i>

> 1. The Software is able to prove the credentials of the holder.


##### \[CP.NOTAR.E1.00019\] External business validations 

###### <i> Description </i>

> The notarization administrator MUST have the possibility to add an external business validation. This MUST be an API GET request to an external system to fetch data. Next to that the service needs to validate the fetched data and include them in the issuance process. The verification process should include the Gaia-X compliance service [7] to make additional checks.
###### [7] [<u>[https://gitlab.com/gaia-x/lab/compliance/gx-compliance]</u>](https://gitlab.com/gaia-x/lab/compliance/gx-compliance)

###### <i> Acceptance Criterias </i>

1.  External data successfully fetched

2.  External data successfully verified


##### \[CP.NOTAR.E1.00020\] Cloud Configuration 

> The provider MUST support advanced cloud configuration by using Kubernetes config maps provided by HELM templates. Additionally, the provider MUST accept dynamic configuration changes over the configuration UI.

##### \[CP.NOTAR.E1.00021\] Dynamic schema (profile) configuration 

> The software extension MUST include dynamic schema configuration. For now, the credential schemas (profiles) can only be configured before starting the service. The software extension MUST include a dynamic schema configuration at run time. That means an endpoint needs to be created which can only be used by the admin of the software or the enabled notaries. For the generation of the profile the component IDM.SR should be used. Based on the different Trust anchor and credential format of the profile the schema regeneration should follow a different flow. The following schema generation flows MUST be supported:

-   EBSI schema generation with the Trusted Schemas Registry fromb EBSI[8]

-   IDUnion (Indy) credential schema creation and credential definition

-   JSON-LD schema context generation and storage on IPFS

###### [8] [<u>[https://api-pilot.ebsi.eu/docs/apis/trusted-schemas-registry/latest#/]</u>](https://api-pilot.ebsi.eu/docs/apis/trusted-schemas-registry/latest#/)

##### \[CP.NOTAR.E1.00028\] Revocation Preparation 

> Additionally, the component MUST prepare an hash-based revocation which is calculated over the proof of the credential in the following way:

-   For RSA signature a SHA256 hash is calculated over the entire signature in raw byte format

-   For EC-DSA Signature the SHA256 hash is calculated over the r value of the proof signature

> The revocation endpoint MUST provide this calculated hash of W3C credentials[10] to an internal storage grouped by Holder DID which has an internal interface to read the hashes for later integration (later integration is out of scope for this tender).

### Metrics

##### \[CP.NOTAR.E1.00047\] Open Telemetry Support

> All helm charts/services MUST provide metrics endpoints in opentelemetry [16] format.

###### [16] [<u>[https://opentelemetry.io/docs/]</u>](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/)

### Configurability

##### \[CP.NOTAR.E1.00048\] Configuration Profiles

> Environment specific parameters MUST be configurable over the helm templates by using profiles. Each component MUST be delivered minimum for profile:

-   DEV, a local environment for round trip development and testing

-   Acceptance, a restricted resource environment (with minimal system requirements) which can be deployed in cluster (remote or locally)

-   Prod, a scalable environment with fault tolerance, HA settings and security hardening


##### \[CP.NOTAR.E1.00049\] Secret References in Helm Charts 

> The configuration secrets within Helm Charts MUST use secretRefs to support external []{#3.5.8_Maintainability .anchor}Secretmanagement. Clear text secrets within the Helm Charts are not allowed.

### Maintainability

#####  \[CP.NOTAR.E1.00050\] Micro Service Architecture 

> For a better scale out, maintainability and decentralization, the product architecture MUST have a micro service architecture. Each microservice MUST NOT be limited on the lines of code or number of days to implement it. The service "size" SHOULD be oriented on the fine granular business capabilities. (e.g., Order, ListMenu, Payment).

##### \[CP.NOTAR.E1.00051\] Domain Driven Design 

> To support the micro service architecture within the maintainability, it MUST be declared a domain model before realization. The software description MUST explain which domain model was chosen, which services contain it and how it scales. This MUST be documented in the public code repository to support future enhancements for new developers.

### Reusability

##### \[CP.NOTAR.E1.00052\] Enterprise Environments 

> All components MUST be reusable in different enterprise environments by customization and white labeling. Means all components MUST be able to customize and white label the components by configuration settings (e.g., UIs, text labels, endpoints etc.)

### Runtime Stability

##### \[CP.NOTAR.E1.00053\] Readiness Checkups 

> All components MUST reflect after bootstrap and during runtime the correctness of the service functionality by reflecting it over health endpoints. The health endpoint MUST return failure (red), if any internal behavior failure or misconfiguration occurs (not just the software running state). This means for instance to check continuously during the runtime:

-   A unreachable configured Services results in failed state

-   Configured Service Endpoints needs to be checked for readiness during runtime, if not reachable, it results in failure state

-   Check depending components (Database, Microservice etc.) behind it, if not reachable, it results in failed state

### High Availability Concepts

##### \[CP.NOTAR.E1.00054\] Redundant Deployment 

> Each deployment MUST be configured for a minimum fault tolerance of 2 instances.

### Proof of Concept

##### \[CP.NOTAR.E1.00055\] Architecture Changes 

> All Architecture Changes MUST be aligned with the Principal before implementation.

# Verification

## Core Verification Requirements

> All listed verification items/criteria must be fulfilled by a demonstration of the implementation within the provided Kubernetes environment.

##### \[CP.NOTAR.E1.00056\] Kubernetes Deployment 



>If the verification is related to software components, it must be deployed in a Kubernetes test cluster and the components must be deployable in a Kubernetes cluster with automated package manager deployment (e.g., Helm). 

----
> ![](./media/image2.png)

>Docker Compose and other local systems can be used for local development and testing, but it's NOT allowed for a final acceptance demonstration.

-----

## Support for Kubernetes

##### \[CP.NOTAR.E1.00057\] Eventing 

> All eventings must be demonstrated on basis of cloud events specifications \[CloudEvents\] together with the kNative [17] broker in a Kubernetes environment.

###### [17] [<u>[https://knative.dev/docs/eventing/]</u>](https://knative.dev/docs/eventing/)

##### \[CP.NOTAR.E1.00058\] Config Map Support 

> Each service must be demonstrated up and running in Kubernetes, configured by config maps.

##### \[CP.NOTAR.E1.00059\] Helm Installation 

> The service installation MUST be demonstrated during HELM install.

##### \[CP.NOTAR.E1.00060\] ArgoCD Integration 

> The helm chart MUST be able to install inside of ArgoCD. This includes the usage of the postgres hooks [18] and the providing of usable values.yaml(s) for all developed services.

###### [18] [<u>[https://gitlab.com/gaia-x/data-infrastructure-federation-services/gxfs-integration/-/tree/main/helm/charts/postgresql-hook]</u>](https://gitlab.com/gaia-x/data-infrastructure-federation-services/gxfs-integration/-/tree/main/helm/charts/postgresql-hook)

##### \[CP.NOTAR.E1.00061\] SCS Environment 

> All HELM installations MUST run on SCS (Sovereign Cloud Stack). The [final acceptance]{.underline} demonstration cannot be realized on azure, google cloud etc.

## Functionality Acceptance Criteria

> Additionally, to the acceptance requirements in the functional description, the following criteria must be considered.

##### \[CP.NOTAR.E1.00062\] Credential Issuance 

> When a DID Document contains multiple Protocols, all of the used wallets contain the issued credential after an notarization.


##### \[CP.NOTAR.E1.00063\] Trustlist Integration 

> The enrollments MUST be visible over the DNS resolvers and the trustlists MUST be updated with the new notarized items. Additionally, the notarization MUST provide the trust list endpoints and DNS zones per public profile with the notarization DID Document.

##### \[CP.NOTAR.E1.00064\] Decision Engine Integration 

> It MUST demonstrate that the notarization API can automatically make decisions for issuing based on OAW and TSA policy outcomes. Note: OAW and TSA MUST be integrated in the demonstration to show the functionality. The environment for these components will be provided by the principal for testing.
